# classical_model_sa_measures_distributions
 This repository contains the Python routines and data used for  research on the Classical Model / Cooke's Method, where different measures of statistical accuracy and two continuous distributions (piecewise uniform and Metalog) for interpolation expert judgments are considered.

## Usage
This code is published for the reproducability and transparency of the aforementioned research.\
- The "scripts" directory contains five scripts that generate the results in the paper
- The "notebooks" directory mainly contains notebooks for postprocessing the sampling results.
The code documentation is limited to inline documentation, feel free to reach out if questions arise.

## Python version
Used (and tested) with Python 3.10. Uses mostly well-known Python modules that can be installed using conda or pip:
- numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy
- anduryl is used for processing expert judgments, the "metalog" branch contains all the functionality used in the study. Check-out or clone this branch to reproduce the results.
